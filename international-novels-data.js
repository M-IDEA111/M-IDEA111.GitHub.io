            <p>The boy's name was Santiago. Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood.</p>
            <p>He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it.</p>

            <p>The gypsy woman examined the boy's hands and said, "You have the hands of a shepherd, not of a fortune-teller."</p>
            <p>"I dreamt that I was in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to play with the animals," the boy said. "And suddenly, the child took me by both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids."</p>
            <p>"Then, at the pyramids, the child said to me, 'If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.' And, just as she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both times."</p>

            <p>"What king?" the boy asked.</p>
            <p>"The king of Salem."</p>
            <p>The boy felt a strange sensation. He thought about the gypsy woman, about the dream, and about the treasure. He was being encouraged to follow his destiny.</p>

            <p>"At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their personal legend."</p>

            <p>"I can clean up those glasses that are covered with dust," the boy said. "The way they are now, nobody would want to buy them. When I have finished cleaning them, I'll leave and you won't have to pay me anything."</p>
            <p>The crystal merchant looked at him without responding. Then he said, "You can work here for a year, and I'll give you enough money to get to Egypt."</p>

            <p>The Englishman carried a small library with him. He spent most of his time reading his books, or making notes in his journal. He told the boy that he was searching for a true alchemist who lived at the Al-Fayoum oasis.</p>
            <p>"The alchemists spent years in their laboratories, observing the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world. They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves."</p>

            <p>The alchemist was dressed in black. His eyes were sharp and bright, and they seemed to see everything. He rode a white horse that was as impressive as he was.</p>
            <p>"You understand the omens," the alchemist said. "You have discovered your personal legend. But you still have much to learn."</p>
            <p>"What must I learn?" the boy asked.</p>
            <p>"You must learn the language of the world. You must listen to your heart. And you must understand that love never keeps a man from pursuing his personal legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it's because it wasn't true love."</p>

            <p>I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975. I remember the precise moment, crouching behind a crumbling mud wall, peeking into the alley near the frozen creek.</p>
            <p>That was a long time ago, but it's wrong what they say about the past, I've learned, about how you can bury it. Because the past claws its way out. Looking back now, I realize I have been peeking into that deserted alley for the last twenty-six years.</p>

            <p>Hassan and I fed from the same breasts. We took our first steps on the same lawn in the same yard. And, under the same roof, we spoke our first words.</p>
            <p>Mine was Baba. His was Amir. My name.</p>
            <p>Looking back on it now, I think the foundation for what happened in the winter of 1975—and all that followed—was already laid in those first words.</p>

            <p>Winter was every kid's favorite season in Kabul, at least those whose fathers could afford to buy a good iron stove. The reason was simple: They shut down school for the icy season. Winter to me was the end of long division and naming the capital of Bulgaria, and the start of three months of playing cards by the stove with Hassan.</p>
            <p>But mostly, winter meant kite fights, and the year I turned twelve, I had never been so eager for winter to arrive. I was going to win the upcoming tournament. I was going to win that winter's tournament. Period.</p>

            <p>I had one last chance to make a decision. One final opportunity to decide who I was going to be. I could step into that alley, stand up for Hassan—the way he'd stood up for me all those times in the past—and accept whatever would happen to me. Or I could run.</p>
            <p>In the end, I ran. I ran because I was a coward. I was afraid of Assef and what he would do to me. I was afraid of getting hurt.</p>

            <p>We left Kabul just after two in the morning. The city was eerily silent. The only sounds were the occasional bark of a dog, the buzzing of the truck's engine, and the crunch of wheels against the snow-covered road.</p>
            <p>Baba sat with his head tilted back against the side of the truck, his eyes closed. I couldn't tell if he was asleep or lost in thought. I watched the city of my childhood recede through the rear window, vanishing into the darkness.</p>

            <p>America was different. America was a river, roaring along, unmindful of the past. I could wade into this river, let my sins drown to the bottom, let the waters carry me someplace far. Someplace with no ghosts, no memories, and no sins.</p>
            <p>For a while, it worked. I graduated from high school at the age of twenty, by far the oldest senior tossing his mortarboard in the air. I enrolled in junior college and took English and writing courses. I published my first novel. I got married.</p>

            <p>I picked up the receiver, dialed information. The operator connected me. The phone rang once, twice. On the third ring, I heard the receiver pick up on the other end.</p>
            <p>"There is a way to be good again," Rahim Khan had said on the phone just before hanging up.</p>

            <p>So what I decided to do, I decided I'd take a room in a hotel in New York—some very inexpensive hotel and all—and just take it easy till Wednesday. Then, on Wednesday, I'd go home all rested up and feeling swell.</p>

            <p>My brother D.B. was in Hollywood. My sister Phoebe was out like a light. I thought of giving Jane Gallagher's mother a buzz, to find out when Jane's vacation started, but I didn't feel like it.</p>

I thought I'd just go down, down, down, and nobody'd ever see me again.</p>

            <p>The door fell flat on the floor and in the doorway stood a giant of a man. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.</p>

            <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.</p>
            <p>In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."</p>

            <p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine.</p>
            <p>I was far from any inhabited country, and in danger of death. So I had to fix it by myself, even though it was a very difficult job.</p>
            <p>It was then that I heard a little voice. It said: "Please... draw me a sheep!"</p>

            <p>The asteroid from which the little prince came is known as B-612. It was sighted by a Turkish astronomer in 1909, who then made a formal demonstration of his discovery at an International Astronomical Congress.</p>

            <p>When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.</p>
            <p>I prop myself up on one elbow. There's enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother's body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down.</p>

It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and I lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything.</p>
            <p>That's how I feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name reverberates across the square. Then I see her, the blood drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage.</p>

This train is sleek and silent, and the cars are filled with luxuries I've never seen before.</p>
            <p>There are plush velvet seats that you can adjust to any position, windows that you can make transparent or opaque, and a table that rises up from the floor with the push of a button. The food is the most astonishing part. Course after course comes from the kitchen, each more delicious than the last.</p>

            <p>As they stood before the famous "Apprentice Pillar," Sophie felt a strange connection to this place. The carvings seemed familiar, as if she had seen them in her dreams.</p>
            <p>Then she saw it - the same symbol that her grandfather had drawn in his final moments. The chalice. The sacred feminine. The Holy Grail.</p>

                        <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.</p>
                        <p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.</p>

                        <p>Winston works at the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to rewrite historical records to match the constantly changing party line. He is responsible for correcting "errors" in past newspaper articles, destroying the original documents, and replacing them with new versions that align with the current political narrative.</p>
                        <p>As he sat at his desk, Winston received a message from the speakwrite indicating which articles needed to be corrected. Today's task involved altering a speech made by Big Brother two years earlier to reflect a change in alliance. Eurasia was now the enemy, and Eastasia was the ally - or was it the other way around?</p>

                        <p>Winston knew what he was doing was dangerous. Keeping a diary was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labor camp.</p>
                        <p>He had committed—would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed forever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.</p>

                        <p>When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh.</p>
                        <p>When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that.</p>

In spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole, staring and wondering.</p>
                        <p>The Radley Place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end; Mrs. Radley ran a boarding-house, but aside from that, she and her husband lived a secluded life. They did not go to church, Maycomb's principal recreation, but worshiped at home.</p>

                        <p>Atticus was proceeding amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute. With his infinite capacity for calming turbulent waters, he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon. Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells, of sleepy-eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the night, "Come out here, boy!"</p>

                        <p>It was Jem's turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd. "It ain't right," he muttered, all the way to the corner of the square where we found Atticus waiting.</p>
                        <p>Atticus was standing under the street light looking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned, his collar and tie were neatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his impassive self again.</p>

                        <p>At the assembly ball, Mr. Bingley soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.

                        <p>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed.</p>
                        <p>He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.

                        <p>Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.

                        <p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.</p>
                        <p>The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.</p>

                            <strong>Book Description:</strong> A multi-generational story of the Buendía family in the fictional town of Macondo.

                        <p>Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs.</p>
                        <p>The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions.</p>

                        <p>First they brought the magnet. A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, made a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia.</p>
                        <p>He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Melquíades' magical irons.</p>

                        <p>Colonel Aureliano Buendía organized thirty-two armed uprisings and he lost them all. He had seventeen male children by seventeen different women and they were exterminated one after the other on a single night before the oldest one had reached the age of thirty-five.</p>
                        <p>He survived fourteen attempts on his life, seventy-three ambushes, and a firing squad. He lived through a dose of strychnine in his coffee that was enough to kill a horse. He refused the Order of Merit, which the President of the Republic awarded him.</p>
                        <p>He rose to be Commander in Chief of the revolutionary forces, with jurisdiction and command from one border to the other, and he was the man most feared by the government, but he never let anyone take his picture.</p>

                        <p>The banana company arrived under the protection of the government. For the first time, Macondo saw its streets paved and its houses painted, and it acquired a permanent and well-lit commercial establishment where for the first time one could buy electric fans, ice-makers, and phonographs.</p>
                        <p>But the foreign invasion also brought with it the seeds of destruction. The company established its own laws, its own police, and its own justice. It paid the workers in scrip that was only good at the company store, where prices were twice as high as in other places.</p>

                        <p>Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.</p>
