                </div>
                <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
                <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
                <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>
                <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
                <p>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it." Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
                <p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.</p>
                <p>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it." This was invitation enough.</p>
                <p>Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.</p>

                <p>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.</p>
                <p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all.</p>
                <p>At the assembly ball, Mr. Bingley soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.</p>
                <p>Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</p>
                <p>Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.</p>

                <p>In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.</p>
                <p>Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed.</p>
                <p>He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding.</p>
                <p>But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty toward whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.</p>
                <p>She lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.</p>

                <p>Be not alarmed, Madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten.</p>
                <p>Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister; and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.</p>
                <p>The first I shall briefly address. The necessity must be obeyed, and farther apology would be absurd. I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.</p>
                <p>Regarding Mr. Wickham, I shall only say that his character and conduct have been grossly misrepresented. The whole of his behaviour toward my family has been marked by deceit and selfishness. I shall not trouble you with particulars; they are too painful for me to dwell on, and would only serve to disgust you further.</p>

                <p>"If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever."</p>
                <p>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances.</p>
                <p>The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him.</p>
                <p>He then told her of his anxiety, his fears, his hopes regarding his influence over her, and his uncertainty about her feelings. He spoke of the letter he had written, his journey to London, and his efforts to find Lydia and Wickham. Every line proved his character to be exactly what Elizabeth had wished to believe it, and she felt an increasing respect for him as she listened.</p>
                <p>The walk was long, and the evening passed quickly away in mutual expressions of affection and plans for the future. When they returned to the house, they were both in excellent spirits, and Elizabeth could not help reflecting on the wonderful change that had taken place in her feelings since the time when she had first known Mr. Darcy.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.</p>
                <p>It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.</p>
                <p>This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.</p>
                <p>There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.</p>

                <p>Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.</p>
                <p>Upon my first hearing of the strange companionship that Ishmael was to have in his bed, I felt something of a shock. But we are all of us in some degree constrained to keep strange bedfellows in this world.</p>
                <p>I stood looking at him a moment. He seemed to take no notice of me, but remained all absorbed in the counting of the pages of the marvelous book. I thought I would see whether he could read, so I took a book from my pocket and offered it to him.</p>
                <p>He took it, examined it attentively, turned it over and over, then gave it back to me, making a sign that he could not read. "What!" said I, "you cannot read your own book?" He shook his head. "Then how came you by it?" I asked.</p>
                <p>He told me, in his broken way, that it had been given him by a ship's captain, who had found him on a desolate island, where he had been left by a whaling vessel. The captain had taught him what he knew of navigation and seamanship, and had given him the book as a parting gift.</p>

                <p>"Sing out for him!" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.</p>
                <p>"Good!" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.</p>
                <p>"And what do ye next, men?"</p>
                <p>"Lower away, and after him!"</p>

                <p>"More and more. But how long since ye last saw this white whale?" demanded Ahab, advancing closer to the crew.</p>
                <p>There was a general movement of uneasiness among the men. They glanced at each other, but no one answered.</p>
                <p>"Speak, thou cook!" cried Ahab, turning to the black man, who stood nearest to him.</p>
                <p>The old man's voice rose like a blast of doom: "Captain Ahab," said he, "it was on our last voyage, in these same seas, that we encountered Moby Dick. It was he that reaped my leg; it was he that left me this dead stump I stand on. It was he that made a poor pegging lubber of me forever and a day!"</p>

                <p>What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid.</p>
                <p>Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form.</p>
                <p>It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.</p>
                <p>Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color, and at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink?</p>
                <p>And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtle deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within.</p>

                <p>That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seemed the naked focus of the glassy ocean's burning-glass. The sky was lavishly transparent, the blue air seemed finely woven silk, that somehow screened the great Japanese sun from being at once bodily present before them.</p>
                <p>At that preluding moment, in fact, all things presented themselves to Ahab with such an intensity of suggestion, that the white whale's presence, though yet at some distance, seemed inevitably impressed upon him.</p>
                <p>"There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!"</p>
                <p>The white whale was now seen swimming swiftly ahead of the boats. His wide forehead, shaped like a battering-ram, smashed through the opposing seas. In his wake, the water seethed and boiled like water in a mill-race.</p>
                <p>"Stand up, Tashtego! Give it to him!" cried Ahab. The harpoon was hurled. The lines ran out. Then—something happened. The line, which had been running out with great speed, suddenly slackened. The boat rocked violently. The men were thrown into confusion.</p>
                <p>Moby Dick had sounded. For a full minute, the deep silence was only broken by the heavy breathing of the men and the lapping of the water against the boat's sides. Then, suddenly, the whale burst from the water not fifty yards from the boat, his entire body visible for a moment in the sunlight before he crashed back into the sea, sending a wave that nearly capsized the fragile craft.</p>

                <p>I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.</p>
                <p>"Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat."</p>
                <p>"For shame! for shame!" cried the lady's-maid. "What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son! Your young master."</p>

                <p>"No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wickedness."</p>
                <p>They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pairs of hands arrested me instantly.</p>
                <p>"If you don't sit still, you must be tied down," said Bessie. "Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly."</p>
                <p>Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.</p>

                <p>I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers.</p>
                <p>He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.</p>

                <p>I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware—"No, sir."</p>

By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-by, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean by it?"</p>
                <p>"Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes differ; that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort."</p>

                <p>"And your will shall decide your destiny," he said: "I offer you my hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions."</p>

                <p>"The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."</p>
                <p>The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under his feet.</p>
                <p>The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued, uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—</p>
                <p>"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr. Rochester has a wife now living."</p>
                <p>My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt frost or fire. But I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.</p>

                <p>I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth. I hold myself supremely blest—blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully as he is mine.</p>
                <p>No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.</p>
                <p>Reader, I married him. When we are together, there is no blindness, no bondage: we are precisely alike in perfect freedom and perfect happiness. To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking.</p>
                <p>All my confidence is bestowed on him, all his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character—perfect concord is the result.</p>
                <p>Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union: perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very close! for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand. Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw nature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round us—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.</p>

                </div>
                <p>1801.—I have just returned from a visit to my landlord—the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society.</p>
                <p>Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Heathcliff?" I said.</p>
                <p>A nod was the answer.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts—"</p>
                <p>"Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir," he interrupted, wincing. "I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it—walk in!"</p>
                <p>The "walk in" was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, "Go to the Deuce": even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.</p>

                <p>"Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?" she said, suddenly, after some minutes' reflection.</p>
                <p>"Yes, now and then," I answered.</p>
                <p>"And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind."</p>
                <p>"I've dreamt that I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers."</p>
                <p>"He shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."</p>
                <p>"My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it."</p>
                <p>"My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being."</p>

                <p>"Oh, Cathy! Oh, my life! how can I bear it?" was the first sentence he uttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.</p>
                <p>"What now?" said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow.</p>
                <p>"You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And you both come to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me—and thriven on it, I think."</p>
                <p>"I have not broken your heart—you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine."</p>
                <p>"So much the worse for me, that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you—oh, God! would you like to live with your soul in the grave?"</p>
                <p>"Let me alone. Let me alone," sobbed Catherine. "If I have done wrong, I'm dying for it. It is enough! You left me too: but I won't upbraid you! I forgive you. Forgive me!"</p>
                <p>"It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted hands," he answered. "Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes! I forgive what you have done to me. I love my murderer—but yours! How can I?"</p>
                <p>They were silent—their faces hid against each other, and washed by each other's tears. At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it seemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.</p>

                <p>About twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss Heathcliff, or know Edgar.</p>
                <p>I cannot say what she died of. I only know that she was taken with a sudden wandering, and raised herself in the bed, with an expression we could not understand.</p>
                <p>"Oh, I will see him! Heathcliff! Heathcliff!" she said, as if she were in some dreadful dream.</p>
                <p>She never spoke again, but her heart beat wildly for a few minutes, then stopped forever.</p>
                <p>She was laid in the drawing-room, not the churchyard, as Edgar had wished; and the funeral was hurried over early in the morning. No one attended but Edgar, myself, the parson, and the men who bore the coffin.</p>
                <p>To my surprise, Heathcliff stood near the gate as we entered the churchyard. He followed us into the church, and remained at the extreme end of the grave during the service. He was calm and collected throughout, except once when he looked at the coffin being lowered, and I thought I saw a shudder run through him.</p>
                <p>When all was done, and the sexton had begun to fill the grave, Heathcliff approached, and pushing him aside, leapt into the pit. He fell on his knees beside the coffin, and began to tear at the wood with his hands.</p>
                <p>"Let me see her once more!" he cried desperately. "Let me see her face!"</p>

                <p>I sank back in bed, and fell into a doze, from which I was awakened by the candle burning down, and the room full of moonlight.</p>
                <p>I heard a fir-bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if possible; and, getting up, I tried to unhasp the casement.</p>
                <p>"Let me in! Let me in!"</p>
                <p>"Who are you?" I asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.</p>
                <p>"Catherine Linton," it replied, shiveringly. "I'm come home: I'd lost my way on the moor!"</p>
                <p>As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking through the window. Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes: still it wailed, "Let me in!" and maintained its tenacious gripe, almost maddening me with fear.</p>
                <p>"How can I!" I said at length. "Let me go, if you want me to let you in!"</p>
                <p>The fingers relaxed, I snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.</p>
                <p>I seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!</p>
                <p>"Begone!" I shouted. "I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years."</p>
                <p>"It is twenty years," mourned the voice: "twenty years. I've been a waif for twenty years!"</p>

                <p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p>
                <p>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs.</p>
                <p>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward.</p>
                <p>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry languidly. "You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse."</p>
                <p>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. "No, I won't send it anywhere."</p>
                <p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whirls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. "Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about."</p>

Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet would pass away from his lips, and the gold steal from his hair.</p>
                <p>A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized himself for the first time. He had never felt that he was so attractive before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him merely the charming exaggerations of friendship.</p>
                <p>He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and his own infinite curiosity about life.</p>
                <p>"How sad it is!" murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait. "How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June... If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!"</p>
                <p>The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had never felt it before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggerations of friendship. He had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him. Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen, his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and deformed. The scarlet would pass away from his lips, and the gold steal from his hair. The life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth.</p>

                <p>He took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the door, a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face and lingered for a moment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him.</p>
                <p>He went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and indignation broke from him. He could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning, and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.</p>
                <p>The thing was still loathsome—more loathsome, if possible, than before—and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.</p>
                <p>Then he loathed his own beauty, and, flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery.</p>
                <p>What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him.</p>
                <p>It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It was of himself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know. The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away. It was already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It was the living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the portrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It was the portrait that had done everything.</p>

                <p>"Come upstairs, Basil," he said, quietly. "I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I will show it to you if you come with me."</p>
                <p>"I will come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow."</p>
                <p>Dorian led the way up the stairs, and as they entered the room, he turned the lamp so that its light fell full upon the portrait.</p>
                <p>"What does this mean?" cried Hallward, at last. His own voice sounded shrill and curious in his ears.</p>
                <p>"Years ago, when I was a boy," said Dorian Gray, crushing the flowers in his hand, "you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment, that, even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer..."</p>
                <p>"I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the thing is impossible."</p>
                <p>"Impossible?" he sneered. "Come and look."</p>
                <p>He tore the curtain from its rod, and flung it on the ground. An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he was looking at! The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth.</p>

                <p>He looked round, and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill the painter's work, and all that that meant.</p>
                <p>He seized it, and stabbed the picture with it.</p>
                <p>There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke, and crept out of their rooms. Two gentlemen, who were passing in the Square below, stopped, and looked up at the great house.</p>
                <p>When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage.</p>
                <p>It was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was. The portrait, however, had changed. It now showed a man of noble and good expression, with the appearance of one who had lived a virtuous life. The subtle smile that played about the lips seemed to suggest a triumph over sin, and the eyes had lost their cunning look and were clear and honest.</p>
                <p>Only when they turned to the dead man on the floor did they see the horror. In his hand he clutched a knife, and on the blade was blood. But the blood was not his own. It was the blood of the portrait, which had dripped from the canvas as he stabbed it.</p>
                <p>The servants stared in horror, unable to comprehend what had happened. How could their young and handsome master have become this wrinkled, hideous creature? And how could the portrait have regained its original beauty?</p>
                <p>It was a mystery that would never be solved. The secret of Dorian Gray died with him, and the portrait alone remained to tell the tale of a life corrupted by vanity and sin.</p>

                </div>
                <p>It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.</p>
                <p>It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.</p>
                <p>How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God!</p>
                <p>His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.</p>
                <p>The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.</p>
                <p>Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.</p>

                <p>"It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses."</p>
                <p>"I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept."</p>
                <p>"Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. I gazed with a kind of wonder."</p>
                <p>"By degrees, I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it."</p>
                <p>"But I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure. I was formed for misery. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous."</p>
                <p>"I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these advantages; but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man."</p>

                <p>"I am alone and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species and have the same defects. This being you must create."</p>
                <p>The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition.</p>
                <p>"You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede."</p>
                <p>"I do refuse it," I replied; "and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world? Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent."</p>
                <p>"You are in the wrong," replied the fiend; "and, instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and, instead of injury, I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union."</p>

                <p>I thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion, tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.</p>
                <p>I left the room, and, locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate the gloom, and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries.</p>
                <p>Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea; it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence, although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a person landed close to my house.</p>
                <p>In a few minutes I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.</p>
                <p>Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared.</p>

                <p>I'm going to the Arctic. There I shall die. But before that, I shall have achieved my destiny. I shall have destroyed the creature I so presumptuously created.</p>
                <p>Why do I still live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my feelings were those of rage and revenge.</p>
                <p>I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of the injuries you inflict.</p>
                <p>But now my wanderings began, which are to cease but with life. I have traversed a vast portion of the earth, and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared not die and leave my adversary in being.</p>
                <p>When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled, and I wandered many hours around the confines of the town, uncertain what path I should pursue. As night approached, I found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer.</p>
                <p>The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the mourner. The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived, and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence.</p>

                <p>4 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35 P.M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.</p>
                <p>The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.</p>
                <p>We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.)</p>
                <p>When I asked the waiter, he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.</p>
                <p>Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country.</p>
                <p>I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe.</p>
                <p>I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.</p>

                <p>Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind, throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door.</p>
                <p>"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!" He made no motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone.</p>
                <p>The instant, however, that I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice—more like the hand of a dead than a living man.</p>
                <p>"Count Dracula?" I said, as I bowed.</p>
                <p>"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in; the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest." As he was speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out, took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I protested but he insisted.</p>
                <p>"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not available. Let me see to your comfort myself." He insisted on carrying my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper, and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished, flamed and flared.</p>
                <p>The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire, which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney.</p>

                <p>I was not alone. The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight, my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by their dress and manner.</p>
                <p>I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips. It is not good to note this down, lest some day it should meet Mina's eyes and cause her pain; but it is the truth.</p>
                <p>Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires.</p>
                <p>All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something about them that made me uneasy, some longing and at the same time some deadly fear. I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips.</p>
                <p>They whispered together, and then they all three laughed—such a silvery, musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips. It was like the intolerable, tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand. The fair girl shook her head coquettishly, and the other two urged her on.</p>
                <p>One said:—</p>
                <p>"Go on! You are first, and we shall follow; yours is the right to begin." The other added:—</p>
                <p>"He is young and strong; there are kisses for us all." I lay quiet, looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation. The fair girl advanced and bent over me till I could feel the movement of her breath upon me. Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.</p>
                <p>I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth.</p>

                <p>She was so tired that she did not seem to have strength to sleep, so I drew the blinds and let the light in. I could see that she was in pain, so I took her hand and began to soothe her. Presently she became quiet, and sank into a sort of lethargy.</p>
                <p>When I drew the blind, the red sunlight streamed in through the crevices, and made the shadows fly before it, till they were all gathered in the dark corners, where they lay still. It was like the dispelling of the evil influence that I had felt in the room.</p>
                <p>But the change in Lucy was even more marked. The lethargy seemed to have passed away, and the old energy had come back; but with it there was a new quality—a sort of diabolical intensity.</p>
                <p>Suddenly she opened her eyes, which were now dull and hard at once, and said in a soft, voluptuous voice, such as I had never heard from her lips:—</p>
                <p>"Arthur! Oh, my love, I am so glad you have come! Kiss me!"</p>
                <p>Arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her; but at that instant Van Helsing, who, like me, had been startled by her voice, swooped upon him, and catching him by the neck with both hands, dragged him back with a fury of strength which I never thought he could have possessed, and actually hurled him almost across the room.</p>
                <p>"Not for your life!" he said; "not for your living soul and hers!" And he stood between them like a lion at bay.</p>
                <p>Arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment realise what had happened; but then his eyes fell upon Lucy's face, and he saw the change that had come over her. He grew pale and gasped:—</p>
                <p>"What does it mean? Dr. Van Helsing, what does it mean?"</p>
                <p>The Professor raised his hand in a gesture of warning, and said in a low voice which nevertheless rang through the room:—</p>
                <p>"Do not stir an inch! Do not speak a word! For your life and hers, do nothing!"</p>
                <p>We all stood still, looking at the poor girl. She lay still for a minute, and then her eyes opened, but they were now hard and cruel, with no recognition in them. She smiled—a smile that made my blood run cold—and said in the same soft, voluptuous voice:—</p>
                <p>"Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!"</p>

                <p>On the instant, with a wild cry of triumph, the whole party launched themselves at the door, but at the same moment the cart whipped up, and we were all flung headlong into the road.</p>
                <p>I was the first to regain my feet, and rushing to the door, I saw the cart disappearing in the semi-darkness. At the same moment I saw the gleam of the great kukri knife as it shore through the air, and the next instant the door fell in, cut through the middle.</p>
                <p>Within, we saw the Count lying in his box, but he was not dead, as we had thought. His eyes were open and fixed on us with a hateful glare, and his face was writhed in a snarl of fury.</p>
                <p>But, oh! the change that had come over him! He seemed to have shrunk in size, and his face was that of a corpse. The eyes were sunken and dim, and the skin was drawn tightly over the high cheekbones. The lips were drawn back from the teeth, which were long and pointed like the fangs of a wolf.</p>
                <p>Jonathan's great knife swept through the air. I shut my eyes, but could not keep them shut, for I had to see what happened. The blow was a true one, and the head of the monster was severed from the body. But, even as the knife swept through the air, the body of the Count seemed to melt away, and to crumble into dust, so that within a few seconds there was nothing left but a little heap of dust on the floor.</p>
                <p>But, oh! the relief! The awful strain was over. The horrible danger was past. The vampire was no more. We looked at each other, and with one accord sank on our knees and gave thanks to God.</p>
                <p>Then we rose, and with a last look at the little heap of dust that was all that remained of Count Dracula, we left the room. As we passed out, the sun rose, and its first rays fell upon the white face of the dead man who lay on the floor. It seemed to give him a look of peace, and we felt that at last he was at rest.</p>
                <p>We buried him that day in the little churchyard of the convent, and over his grave we placed a simple stone with the inscription:—</p>
                <p>"Here lies the body of Count Dracula, who died in the year of our Lord 1897. May he rest in peace."</p>
                <p>And so ends the story of the vampire, as far as we know it. But sometimes, when the night is dark and the wind howls round the house, I think of that little heap of dust in the castle in Transylvania, and wonder if it is really the end.</p>

                    <strong>Book Description:</strong> Huck Finn's journey down the Mississippi River with the runaway slave Jim.
                </div>
                <p>You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.</p>
                <p>That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom's Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</p>
                <p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.</p>
                <p>Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them—that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.</p>
                <p>After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.</p>
                <p>Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.</p>

                <p>I had shut the door to. Then I turned around, and there he was. I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much. I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was mistaken—that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected.</p>
                <p>Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of him telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me; never said nothing.</p>
                <p>Then I says: "It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make up your camp fire good."</p>
                <p>"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain't you? Den we kin get sumfn better den strawbries."</p>
                <p>"Strawberries and such truck," I says. "Is that what you live on?"</p>
                <p>"I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.</p>
                <p>"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"</p>
                <p>"I come heah de night arter you's killed."</p>

                <p>"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?"</p>
                <p>"No, sah—nuffn else."</p>
                <p>"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"</p>
                <p>"I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long you ben on de islan'?"</p>
                <p>"Since the night I got killed."</p>
                <p>"No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you got a gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat's good. Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire."</p>
                <p>So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft.</p>

                <p>It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.</p>
                <p>Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.</p>
                <p>We laid up all the day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp fire—no, she'd fetch a dog.</p>
                <p>Now and then we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts. It's lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.</p>
                <p>Jim said they was made, but I reckoned they just happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done.</p>
                <p>We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest. Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.</p>

                <p>It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:</p>
                <p>"All right, then, I'll go to hell"—and tore it up.</p>
                <p>It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.</p>
                <p>And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.</p>
                <p>Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.</p>
                <p>I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little stream that was coming out there on the bank.</p>
                <p>Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, "Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just yet—I only wanted to get the lay of the land.</p>
                <p>According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the river, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:</p>

                <p>But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.</p>
                <p>The widow she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out.</p>
                <p>I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable.</p>
                <p>So I went back.</p>
                <p>The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.</p>
                <p>But when I went to bed that night, I couldn't sleep for thinking about Jim and the river and the stars and how free we was out there. And then I thought about how Aunt Sally was fixing to adopt me and civilize me, and I couldn't stand it. I been there before.</p>
                <p>So I made up my mind I'd light out for the Territory ahead of the rest. I'd done it before when I was with Pap, and I could do it again. Only this time I'd go further—maybe out to where them mountains was, where you could see forever and nobody to tell you what to do.</p>
                <p>But then I got to thinking about Tom and how he'd want to come too, and that wouldn't do because Tom would want to do everything regular and by the book, and that would take all the fun out of it. So I decided not to tell him. I'd just slip away one night when everybody was asleep.</p>
                <p>But I reckon I got to stop here. I can't write no more. I'm getting tired, and my hand is cramping up. Besides, there ain't nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.</p>

                </div>
                <p>On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon, from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.</p>
                <p>As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d'If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island.</p>
                <p>Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden in the dockyard of old Phocéa, and belongs to an owner of the city.</p>
                <p>The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board.</p>
                <p>However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.</p>
                <p>The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into the creek of La Réserve.</p>
                <p>When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship's bulwarks. He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven's wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.</p>

                <p>At this moment the door opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, and four soldiers, with a corporal, entered the room. The joy which had pervaded every heart was succeeded by a feeling of terror.</p>
                <p>"The imperial prosecutor's orders!" said the magistrate; and, leaving these words to produce their effect, which was that of a thunderbolt in the midst of the guests, he added, "I am compelled to perform my duty."</p>
                <p>Edmond saw that he was the object of this visit. He advanced towards the magistrate, and said, "I am Edmond Dantès, what do you want with me?"</p>
                <p>"We will tell you that," replied the magistrate, making a sign to his men, who immediately surrounded Edmond.</p>
                <p>"But at least," said Dantès, "will you have the goodness to inform me of the cause of this arrest?"</p>
                <p>"I am forbidden to do so; but to-morrow you will be informed before the judge."</p>
                <p>Mercedes uttered a piercing cry, and threw herself into the arms of Edmond.</p>
                <p>"Edmond! Edmond!" she cried, "what is the matter? They are going to arrest you—to take you away from me!"</p>
                <p>"Calm yourself, my dear Mercedes," said Dantès, "and do not alarm yourself. There is some mistake, and you may be sure it will be cleared up."</p>
                <p>"But they are arresting you—they are taking you away!"</p>
                <p>"Do not be afraid; I shall soon return."</p>
                <p>"Where are you taking him?" cried Mercedes, addressing the magistrate.</p>
                <p>"Where we are ordered to take him," replied the man; "but I believe it is to the Palais de Justice."</p>
                <p>Mercedes followed the soldiers with her eyes until they disappeared at the end of the street; then she fell, half fainting, into the arms of her friends.</p>
                <p>Dantès, accompanied by the soldiers, descended the staircase, crossed the court, and got into a carriage which was waiting at the door. Two soldiers placed themselves one on each side of him, the magistrate sat opposite, the door was closed, and the carriage rolled heavily over the stones.</p>
                <p>"Where are we going?" asked Dantès.</p>
                <p>"You will see," replied the magistrate.</p>
                <p>Dantès, accustomed to obey, knew that it would be useless to question a man who replied in such a manner; he therefore remained silent, but his mind was at work, trying to imagine what could have given rise to this arrest.</p>

                <p>The prisoner whom Edmond had heard digging was on the other side of the wall, about fifteen feet from him. Instead of abandoning his project, he set to work with more determination than ever.</p>
                <p>Suddenly an idea flashed across his mind. He stopped, wiped his forehead, and reflected.</p>
                <p>"Suppose it is another prisoner trying to escape?" said he to himself. "Suppose I meet a murderer, a thief, a villain—in a word, a criminal, who would rather kill a man than let his secret be known?"</p>
                <p>But the thought did not stop him. He worked on for two hours longer, and then a hollow sound indicated that the other prisoner was also at work.</p>
                <p>Edmond listened; the other prisoner had evidently heard the noise and had redoubled his efforts. Edmond worked with renewed vigor; he was filled with hope. Suddenly, the tool in his hand struck against something hard. He drew it back and inserted it again. It was a beam.</p>
                <p>At this moment the other prisoner stopped. Edmond heard him move away. No doubt he had been alarmed by the noise. Edmond redoubled his efforts; he succeeded in removing the beam, but found that he could not get through the opening; it was too small.</p>
                <p>He then set to work to enlarge it, but he had scarcely begun when he heard the other prisoner return. This time he was not alone; Edmond could distinguish the sound of two voices.</p>
                <p>"I tell you I am not mistaken," said one of the voices, which Edmond recognized as that of the prisoner he had heard digging. "I have been working for more than a year, and I have calculated exactly. This wall is the outer wall of the Château d'If."</p>
                <p>"But if it is," replied the other voice, which was strange to Edmond, "you are lost. The sea is at the foot of this wall, and the fall is more than a hundred feet."</p>
                <p>"I know it," said the first speaker; "but I have prepared for that. I have a rope ladder, and I have calculated the distance. I shall let myself down from this window."</p>
                <p>"But the guards?"</p>
                <p>"They are changed at midnight; we have an hour before us."</p>
                <p>"Are you sure?"</p>
                <p>"I have watched them for a month."</p>
                <p>"Then let us lose no time."</p>
                <p>Edmond heard a noise as of some heavy body being dragged along the floor. Then there was a sound of blows, as if someone were striking the wall with a hammer. Edmond understood; the prisoner was driving a peg into the wall to fasten his rope ladder.</p>

                <p>Edmond inserted the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid, and pressing with all his force on the handle, burst the fastenings. The hinges yielded with a terrific noise, and the lid fell back, disclosing to view a second case, of wood, in the middle of which was a sheet of red cloth covering a large quantity of gold pieces.</p>
                <p>Dantès seized the pickaxe again, and attacked the inner case. The wood yielded to the sharp tool, and disclosed a large cavity, blue with the powder of sapphires, red with the rubies, and green with the emeralds.</p>
                <p>After having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed through the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock, from whence he could behold the sea. He was alone—alone with these countless, these unheard-of treasures!</p>
                <p>Was he awake, or was it but a dream? He needed to touch his gold and his jewels, to gaze upon them, to feel that he was not dreaming. He went back to the grotto, and found himself again before his mine of gold and jewels. This time he fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively, uttered a prayer intelligible to God alone.</p>
                <p>He soon became calmer and more happy, for only now did he begin to realize his good fortune. He then set himself to work to count his fortune. There were a thousand ingots of gold, each weighing about two pounds; then he piled up twenty-five thousand crowns, each worth about four dollars of our money, and bearing the effigies of Alexander VI. and his predecessors; and he saw that the compartment was not half empty. And he measured ten double handfuls of pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which, mounted by the most famous workmen, were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth.</p>
                <p>Dantès saw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised in the cavern, left it, his gun in his hand. A piece of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours' sleep, lying over the mouth of the cave.</p>
                <p>It was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous emotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.</p>

                <p>Mondego uttered a cry, and fell on his knees.</p>
                <p>"Rise," said the count, "your life is safe; the same good fortune has not happened to your accomplices—one is mad, the other dead. Keep the fifty thousand francs you have left, I give them to you. The five millions stolen from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown hand."</p>

                <p>"Your wife has been paid with the life of her father; your child will live, but will never know his father's shame."</p>
                <p>Fernand bowed his head under this crushing curse; his eyes were bloodshot, his chest heaved, and he appeared like a tiger under the influence of overpowering rage.</p>
                <p>"Oh," he said, "I know who you are now—the man I betrayed, the man I dishonoured, the man whose life I destroyed. But you are mistaken if you think you have made me suffer enough. There are tortures which you have not inflicted, and which I reserve for myself."</p>
                <p>"What do you mean?" asked Monte Cristo.</p>
                <p>"I mean that you have left me my honour, and with my honour I can live or die as I please. You have not taken from me the means of ending my sufferings when they become intolerable."</p>
                <p>And before Monte Cristo could put out a hand to stop him, Fernand had snatched a pistol from his breast and placed the muzzle in his mouth.</p>
                <p>A loud report followed, and the wretch fell, his face horribly disfigured, his brains scattered on the carpet.</p>
                <p>Monte Cristo looked at him for a moment in silence, then said calmly:—</p>
                <p>"I had forgotten this detail."</p>
                <p>Then, ringing the bell, he said to the servant who appeared:—</p>
                <p>"Carry this body into the next room, and send for the coroner."</p>
                <p>Then, turning to Morcerf, who had witnessed this scene with terror:—</p>
                <p>"M. Albert," said he, "you see that God does not always punish visibly. Fernand Mondego has escaped human justice, but divine justice has overtaken him. This man, who betrayed his benefactor, who sold his master, who caused the death of your grandfather, who married the woman he had dishonoured, who caused the death of your father—this man is dead by his own hand. God has judged him."</p>

                </div>
                <p>On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.</p>
                <p>He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more like a cupboard than a room.</p>
                <p>The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which he hated, and which made him scowl.</p>
                <p>He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her. This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all.</p>
                <p>He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to lie—no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.</p>
                <p>This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears.</p>
                <p>"I want to attempt a thing like that and am frightened by these trifles," he thought, with an odd smile. "Hm... yes, all is in a man's hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that's an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most... But I am talking too much. It's because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I've learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It's simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything."</p>

                <p>He took the axe all the way out, swung it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He seemed not to be using any strength. But as soon as he had once brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.</p>
                <p>The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat's tail and fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck. As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull.</p>
                <p>She cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held "the pledge." Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the body fell back.</p>
                <p>He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets, the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.</p>
                <p>He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her pocket (trying to avoid the streaming blood)—the same right-hand pocket from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his hands were still trembling.</p>
                <p>He remembered afterwards that he had been particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get smeared with blood... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all, as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images. Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean with a silk patchwork quilt. Against the third wall was a chest of drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back. He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest, he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side.</p>

                <p>"I only believe in my leading idea that men are in general divided by a law of nature into two categories, into ordinary men and into extraordinary men. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal."</p>
                <p>"Both have the same right to exist. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, must from their very nature be criminals. If they succeed, people put up statues to them; if they fail, they are executed."</p>
                <p>"The first category are always the masters of the present, the second—the masters of the future. The first preserve the world and increase it numerically; the second move the world and lead it to its goal."</p>
                <p>"I believe that Napoleon and others like him were not restrained from shedding blood by any scruple, if that blood—and often innocent blood—stood in their way. I fancy that many of the benefactors of mankind, who were not invested with power, but on the contrary, were at the head of new movements, must have taken life. People think that in saying this I am justifying my crime, but that is not so. I am only stating a fact."</p>
                <p>"The ordinary man has to live in submission, has no right to transgress the law, because, don't you see, he is ordinary. But the extraordinary man has the right—that is, not an official right, but his own right—to allow his conscience to overstep... certain obstacles, but only in the event that his ideas (which may sometimes be salutary for all mankind) require it for their fulfillment."</p>
                <p>"In short, I maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have been in duty bound... to eliminate the dozen or the hundred men for the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity."</p>
                <p>"But you don't suppose that I went to the old woman's simply to rob her?"</p>
                <p>"Of course not," answered Raskolnikov with contempt. "I consider that if on the one hand the discoveries of a Kepler or a Newton could not have been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one or more men, then Newton would have had the right, and even the duty... to remove those men in order to make known his discoveries to all mankind. But it does not follow from that that Newton had the right to murder people right and left, or to steal every day in the market."</p>

                <p>Sonya looked at him in dismay. She had thought she knew what he was going to say, yet when he said it she was appalled. She jumped up, trembling, and looked at him, wringing her hands. It was as though she did not understand.</p>
                <p>"Why have you done this to yourself?" she said in despair, and flinging herself on her knees before him, she burst into tears.</p>
                <p>"I killed a human being, not a principle! I killed, I killed the life in myself. I've murdered myself, not her! I crushed myself once for all, forever... But the old woman was a mistake."</p>
                <p>Sonya seized both his hands and, squeezing them tight in her thin fingers, which felt like a vice, gazed at him fixedly, as though seeking support and hope. Her pale face worked terribly, her lips twitched, trying to utter something.</p>
                <p>She seemed not to understand, and could not understand. Only one thing she understood, that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy.</p>
                <p>"What shall I do now?" she asked, looking at him with eyes full of agony.</p>
                <p>"What you will," he answered. "But don't leave me, Sonya. I can't be alone. I shall go to the police myself, but if I go alone, I shall not have the strength. Be with me, go with me."</p>
                <p>"I will go with you," she said softly, as though in a dream, not yet fully realizing what was happening. "But where? Where shall we go?"</p>
                <p>"How do I know? I only know that we must go, that we must not delay. Go with me to the cross-roads, show me where to go... when the time comes. You know I came to you yesterday to ask you to go with me... You are my one hope, my one refuge. I could not bear it alone. If you won't go with me, I shall go alone, but what will become of me then?"</p>
                <p>"Don't, don't speak like that," Sonya interrupted him in anguish. "You will destroy yourself! Better give yourself up and repent."</p>
                <p>"I shall give myself up, but what is repentance? I killed a vile, harmful louse, a filthy old moneylender who sucked the life-blood of the poor. What is there to repent of? They think I am a criminal—let them. They see my degradation—let them. I go to meet suffering. But I don't repent of the murder itself. How could I repent? If I had to do it again, I should do it again."</p>

                <p>But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.</p>
                <p>He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.</p>
                <p>But that is the beginning of a new story—the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.</p>
                <p>Raskolnikov was sitting on the river bank, looking at the wide, deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape was visible. From the other bank far away came the faint sound of singing. There, in the boundless steppe, flooded with sunlight, the black tents of the nomads were dotted like specks. There was freedom there, there other people were living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.</p>
                <p>Raskolnikov sat, gazed persistently, motionless; his thoughts passed into dreams, into contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him.</p>
                <p>Suddenly Sonya was beside him. She had come up noiselessly and sat down beside him. It was still early, the morning chill was still in the air. She wore her old burnous and the green shawl. Her face showed signs of illness, it was thinner and paler. She gave him a friendly smile, but held out her hand to him with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always seemed vexed to meet her, was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved. But this time their hands did not part; he stole a rapid glance at her, said nothing, and dropped his eyes on the ground. They were alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away at that moment.</p>
                <p>How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come...</p>
                <p>They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other.</p>
                <p>They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being, while she—she only lived in his life.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked, Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound to be so. Wasn't everything now bound to be changed?</p>
                <p>He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale, thin little face. But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings.</p>
                <p>And what were all, all the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have analyzed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind.</p>
                <p>Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically. The book belonged to Sonya; it was the one from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word. Till now he had not opened it.</p>
                <p>He did not open it now, but one thought passed through his mind: "Can her convictions not be mine now? Her feelings, her aspirations at least..."</p>
                <p>She too had been greatly agitated that day, and at night she was taken ill again. But she was so happy—and so unexpectedly happy—that she was almost frightened of her happiness. Seven years, only seven years! At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days. He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.</p>

                    <strong>Book Description:</strong> A novel about the American dream, love, and the Roaring Twenties.
                </div>
                <p>In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.</p>
                <p>"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."</p>
                <p>He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.</p>
                <p>The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.</p>
                <p>Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.</p>
                <p>And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the "creative temperament"—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</p>

                text: `<div class="episode-title">Chapter 3: The Rhythm of His Parties</div>
                <p>There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam.</p>
                <p>On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.</p>
                <p>Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.</p>
                <p>At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.</p>
                <p>By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair, but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing up-stairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors, and hair shorn in strange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.</p>
                <p>The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.</p>

                <p>After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer's automobile rounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner—I felt sure he wouldn't eat a mouthful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden.</p>
                <p>It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.</p>
                <p>I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him, for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.</p>
                <p>There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day. It was the kind of day that made you want to get up early and take a long walk, and then come home and read. I decided to walk over to Gatsby's. His house was still and empty when I arrived—the grass on his lawn was long and the newspaper boy had thrown the Saturday Evening Post against the kitchen door—but I felt that he was in the house, hiding perhaps, as I walked up the front steps.</p>
                <p>I rang the bell. After a moment the door was opened by a butler I had never seen before—a pale, well-built man with intelligent eyes and a manner that suggested he had been better trained than most of Gatsby's staff.</p>
                <p>"Is Mr. Gatsby at home?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"Mr. Gatsby is not at home to anyone," he said with finality.</p>
                <p>"I'm a neighbor of his."</p>
                <p>"Oh." He seemed to consider. "Won't you come in? Mr. Gatsby will be down in a minute."</p>
                <p>I stepped inside. The hall was cool and dark. I could hear a clock ticking somewhere. The butler disappeared and I was left alone in the silence. I stood there looking at the familiar surroundings—the marble floor, the high ceiling, the great staircase that swept up to the second floor. Everything was as I remembered it, yet somehow different. The house had a deserted, waiting air.</p>
                <p>Then I heard footsteps on the stairs and turned to see Gatsby coming down. He was dressed in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, and he looked as if he hadn't slept. His face was pale and his eyes were tired, but he smiled when he saw me—the rare, understanding smile that you may come across four or five times in life.</p>
                <p>"Old sport," he said, shaking hands with me. It was the first time he had called me that in weeks. "I'm glad you came over. I was just thinking about you."</p>
                <p>"I was out for a walk and thought I'd drop in."</p>
                <p>"Good." He seemed abstracted. "Let's go out to the garden. It's cooler there."</p>
                <p>We went through the French windows and out onto the terrace. The afternoon was fading and the lights in the houses across the bay were beginning to come on. Gatsby stood with his hands in his pockets, looking out at the water. For several minutes he said nothing. Then he turned to me with an abrupt movement.</p>
                <p>"I suppose you've heard about the party," he said.</p>
                <p>"I heard it was quite a success."</p>
                <p>"It was a terrible party." He shook his head. "Who wants to go to a party with a lot of people you don't know? I didn't know half the people there."</p>
                <p>"I thought you enjoyed giving parties."</p>
                <p>"I did—once. But not anymore." He paused. "You see, I had an object in giving parties. I wanted to see if she would come."</p>
                <p>"Daisy?"</p>
                <p>He nodded. "I bought this house so that I would be just across the bay from her. I thought that if she saw the parties, the lights, the people coming and going, she might wander over some night. I wanted her to see my house." He spread his arms in a gesture that took in the gardens, the house, the whole establishment. "I wanted her to see all this."</p>
                <p>"And did she ever come?"</p>
                <p>"Once." His voice was low. "She came once, about a month ago. She was with Tom. They stayed about an hour and then left. She didn't even know who I was."</p>
                <p>He was silent again, looking out at the green light that marked the end of Daisy's dock. I could see it from where we stood—a tiny, faraway point of emerald in the darkness.</p>
                <p>"Old sport," he said suddenly, "I'm going to ask you a favor. I want you to invite Daisy to tea."</p>
                <p>"To tea?"</p>
                <p>"Yes. Here. Tomorrow. At four o'clock."</p>
                <p>"But why don't you ask her yourself?"</p>
                <p>"I can't. She doesn't know I'm here. She doesn't know about the house, about any of this. I want it to be a surprise."</p>
                <p>I hesitated. "Gatsby, are you sure this is a good idea? After all these years?"</p>
                <p>"It's been five years, Nick. Five years next November." He turned to me, and for the first time I saw the desperation in his eyes. "I've got to see her. I've waited too long already."</p>

                <p>"Your wife doesn't love you," said Gatsby. "She's never loved you. She loves me."</p>
                <p>"You must be crazy!" exclaimed Tom automatically.</p>
                <p>Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.</p>
                <p>"She never loved you, do you hear?" he cried. "She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!"</p>
                <p>At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake of their emotion.</p>
                <p>"Sit down, Daisy," Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. "What's been going on? I want to hear all about it."</p>
                <p>"I told you what's been going on," said Gatsby. "Going on for five years—and you didn't know."</p>
                <p>Tom turned to Daisy sharply.</p>
                <p>"You've been seeing this fellow for five years?"</p>
                <p>"Not seeing," said Gatsby. "No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes."—but there was no laughter in his eyes—"to think that you didn't know."</p>
                <p>"Oh—that's all." Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.</p>
                <p>"You're crazy!" he exploded. "I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then—and I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a God damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now."</p>
                <p>"No," said Gatsby, shaking his head.</p>
                <p>"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn't know what she's doing." He nodded sagely. "And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time."</p>
                <p>"You're revolting," said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: "Do you know why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree."</p>
                <p>Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.</p>
                <p>"Daisy, that's all over now," he said earnestly. "It doesn't matter anymore. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it's all wiped out forever."</p>
                <p>She looked at him blindly. "Why—how could I love him—possibly?"</p>
                <p>"You never loved him."</p>
                <p>She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.</p>
                <p>"I never loved him," she said, with perceptible reluctance.</p>
                <p>"Not at Kapiolani?" demanded Tom suddenly.</p>
                <p>"No."</p>
                <p>From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.</p>
                <p>"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. "... Daisy?"</p>
                <p>"Please don't." Her voice was cold, but the rancor was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. "There, Jay," she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.</p>
                <p>"Oh, you want too much!" she cried to Gatsby. "I love you now—isn't that enough? I can't help what's past." She began to sob helplessly. "I did love him once—but I loved you too."</p>
                <p>Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.</p>
                <p>"You loved me too?" he repeated.</p>
                <p>"Even that's a lie," said Tom savagely. "She didn't know you were alive. Why—there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget."</p>
                <p>The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.</p>
                <p>"I want to speak to Daisy alone," he insisted. "She's all excited now—"</p>
                <p>"Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom," she admitted in a pitiful voice. "It wouldn't be true."</p>
                <p>"Of course it wouldn't," agreed Tom.</p>
                <p>She turned to her husband.</p>
                <p>"As if it mattered to you," she said.</p>
                <p>"Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on."</p>
                <p>"You don't understand," said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. "You're not going to take care of her anymore."</p>
                <p>"I'm not?" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. "Why's that?"</p>
                <p>"Daisy's leaving you."</p>
                <p>"Nonsense."</p>
                <p>"I am, though," she said with a visible effort.</p>
                <p>"She's not leaving me!" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. "Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he put on her finger."</p>
                <p>"I won't stand this!" cried Daisy. "Oh, please let's get out."</p>
                <p>"Who are you, anyhow?" broke out Tom. "You're one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfsheim—that much I happen to know. I've made a little investigation into your affairs—and I'll carry it further tomorrow."</p>
                <p>"You can suit yourself about that, old sport." said Gatsby steadily.</p>
                <p>"I found out what your 'drug-stores' were." He turned to us and spoke rapidly. "He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug-stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn't far wrong."</p>
                <p>"What about it?" said Gatsby politely. "I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to come in on it."</p>
                <p>"And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of you."</p>
                <p>"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport."</p>
                <p>"Don't you call me 'old sport'!" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. "Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfsheim scared him into shutting his mouth."</p>
                <p>That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.</p>
                <p>"That drug-store business was just small change," continued Tom slowly, "but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me about."</p>
                <p>I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had "killed a man." For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.</p>
                <p>It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.</p>

                text: `<div class="episode-title">Chapter 9: The Funeral and Final Reflection</div>
                <p>After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.</p>
                <p>I found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.</p>
                <p>The morning after the death I saw the board of directors of his company—the "gonnegtions" he had boasted about. They were all there—except one man, the one he had mentioned most often, who had been his closest friend and who was supposed to be coming from Detroit. They were respectable-looking men, all of them, dressed in sober business suits, and they spoke in low, respectful tones. They looked at the body with that peculiarly unemotional curiosity that is characteristic of Americans. Then they went away, and I was left alone again.</p>
                <p>About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months before.</p>
                <p>I'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the funeral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby's grave.</p>
                <p>I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already too far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur "Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on," and then the owl-eyed man said "Amen to that," in a brave voice.</p>
                <p>We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.</p>
                <p>"I couldn't get to the house," he remarked.</p>
                <p>"Neither could anybody else."</p>
                <p>"Go on!" He started. "Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds."</p>
                <p>He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.</p>
                <p>"The poor son-of-a-bitch," he said.</p>
                <p>One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gayeties, to bid them a hasty good-by. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That's and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: "Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?" and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.</p>
                <p>When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again.</p>
                <p>That's my middle-west—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.</p>
                <p>Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares.</p>
                <p>After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.</p>
                <p>There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together, and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big chair.</p>
                <p>She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say good-bye.</p>
                <p>"Nevertheless you did throw me over," said Jordan suddenly. "You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now, but it was a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while."</p>
                <p>We shook hands.</p>
                <p>"Oh, and do you remember—" she added, "—a conversation we had once about driving a car?"</p>
                <p>"Why—not exactly."</p>
                <p>"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride."</p>
                <p>"I'm thirty," I said. "I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."</p>
                <p>She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.</p>
                <p>One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.</p>
                <p>"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?"</p>
                <p>"Yes. You know what I think of you."</p>
                <p>"You're crazy, Nick," he said quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you."</p>
                <p>"Tom," I inquired, "what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?"</p>
                <p>He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.</p>
                <p>"I told him the truth," he said. "He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—" He broke off defiantly. "What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car."</p>
                <p>There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true.</p>
                <p>"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—"</p>
                <p>I couldn't forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...</p>
                <p>I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.</p>
                <p>Gatsby's house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.</p>
                <p>I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.</p>
                <p>On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.</p>
                <p>Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.</p>
                <p>And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.</p>
                <p>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning—</p>
                <p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p>

                    <strong>Book Description:</strong> A Socratic dialogue about justice, the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man.
                </div>
                <p>I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new thing.</p>
                <p>I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him.</p>
                <p>The servant caught hold of my cloak from behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.</p>
                <p>I turned round, and asked him where his master was.</p>
                <p>There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.</p>
                <p>Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus appeared with Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the son of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.</p>
                <p>Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your companion are already on your way to the city.</p>
                <p>You are not far wrong, I said.</p>
                <p>But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?</p>
                <p>Of course.</p>
                <p>And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain where you are.</p>
                <p>May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let us go?</p>
                <p>But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.</p>
                <p>Certainly not, replied Glaucon.</p>
                <p>Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.</p>
                <p>Adeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?</p>
                <p>With horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race?</p>
                <p>Yes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated at night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be perverse.</p>
                <p>Glaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.</p>
                <p>Very good, I replied.</p>
                <p>Accordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found his brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the Chalcedonian, Charmantides the Paianian, and Cleitophon the son of Aristonymus. There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had not seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged. He was seated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had been sacrificing in the court.</p>
                <p>We went and sat down at his side. He welcomed me eagerly, and then he said:—</p>
                <p>You don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were still able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener to the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation. Do not then deny my request, but make our house your resort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends, and you will be quite at home with us.</p>
                <p>I replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus, than conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'—Is life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?</p>

                text: `<div class="episode-title">Book 2: The Challenge of Injustice</div>
                <p>They say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just.</p>
                <p>This they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice; it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice.</p>
                <p>For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.</p>
                <p>Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law.</p>
                <p>The liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended.</p>
                <p>Now the shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials of the ring, and always with the same result—when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared.</p>
                <p>Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among men.</p>
                <p>Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they are right.</p>

                text: `<div class="episode-title">Book 7: The Cave and The Light</div>
                <p>And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened: Behold! human beings living in an underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads.</p>
                <p>Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.</p>
                <p>I see.</p>
                <p>And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others silent.</p>
                <p>You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.</p>
                <p>Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?</p>
                <p>True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?</p>
                <p>And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?</p>
                <p>Yes, he said.</p>
                <p>And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?</p>
                <p>Very true.</p>
                <p>And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?</p>
                <p>No question, he replied.</p>
                <p>To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images.</p>
                <p>That is certain.</p>
                <p>And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision—what will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them—will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?</p>
                <p>Far truer.</p>
                <p>And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?</p>
                <p>True, he said.</p>
                <p>And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities.</p>
                <p>Not all in a moment, he said.</p>
                <p>He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day?</p>
                <p>Certainly.</p>
                <p>Last of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.</p>
                <p>Certainly.</p>
                <p>He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold?</p>
                <p>Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.</p>
                <p>And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change, and pity them?</p>
                <p>Certainly, he would.</p>
                <p>And if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, do you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,</p>
                <p>'Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,'</p>
                <p>and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after their manner?</p>
                <p>Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.</p>
                <p>Imagine once more, I said, such a one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness?</p>
                <p>To be sure, he said.</p>
                <p>And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable), would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him to death.</p>
                <p>No question, he said.</p>
                <p>This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed—whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed.</p>
                <p>I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.</p>
                <p>Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.</p>
                <p>Yes, very natural.</p>
                <p>And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?</p>
                <p>Anything but surprising, he replied.</p>

                description: "Socrates argues that philosophers should rule",
                image: "republic.jpg",
                text: `<div class="episode-title">Book 5: The Rule of Reason</div>
                <p>Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils—no, nor the human race, as I believe—and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day.</p>
                <p>Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon, which I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant; for to be convinced that in no other State can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing.</p>
                <p>Socrates, what do you mean? I can assure you that when you first spoke, and so often afterwards, you appeared to me to be uttering paradoxes; but now, as I gradually understand your meaning, I perceive that you are in earnest, and that the truth is as you say.</p>
                <p>Yes, I am in earnest, I replied; and you will be more in earnest when you have heard what I am going to say.</p>
                <p>What is that?</p>
                <p>The greatest number of the evils of which mankind complain have their origin in the body and its desires; and these are what we call the necessary desires, because they are forced upon us by nature, and cannot be got rid of. But the truth is that these desires are the source of wars and factions and fighting, and that the real cause of them is the desire for wealth, which is acquired for the sake of the body and is kept in subjection by its service. And hence arises the rule of the passionate and contentious element, because wealth is for the sake of the body.</p>
                <p>And so men, because they are afraid of others, desire to get the better of them, and hence they become enemies to one another. And from these enmities arise wars, and from wars the destruction of states and the loss of property and life; and thus men lose their dearest possessions.</p>
                <p>Very true.</p>
                <p>And the cause of all this is the excessive love of the body and its pleasures and appetites; this it is which leads men to fight with one another, and makes them ready to do anything to satisfy their desires. And therefore, as I was saying, the true captain of the soul ought to be reason, and not passion or appetite, and he should pilot the vessel of state in accordance with reason.</p>
                <p>But who is this true pilot? And how is he to be found?</p>
                <p>He is the philosopher, I replied, who has a knowledge of the eternal and immutable, and who is able to contemplate the absolute good. Such an one we have described as having his eye fixed upon the idea of good, and as regulating his life and the lives of others according to that pattern.</p>
                <p>But is such an one to be found? And if found, will he be willing to rule?</p>
                <p>That is the difficulty, I said; and yet, if we consider, we shall see that there is a necessity which will compel him.</p>
                <p>What necessity?</p>
                <p>The necessity which is laid upon him of not being useless. For if he were useless, he would not be doing that for which he is fitted by nature; and he would be like a skilled artisan who refuses to work at his trade.</p>
                <p>But is there not a danger that he may be corrupted by the world, and lose his love of wisdom?</p>
                <p>There is, I said; and therefore we must take care how we educate him. He must be trained from his youth upward in the love of truth and hatred of falsehood, and he must be accustomed to look at things in their true light, and not to be dazzled by appearances.</p>
                <p>And how is this to be done?</p>
                <p>By a right education, I said; and this education must be of the whole man, and not of parts only. He must be taught music and gymnastic in due proportion, that the soul may be harmonious and the body a fit instrument for the soul. And when he has passed through the earlier stages of education, he must be led to the study of dialectic, that he may be able to give an account of the reason of things, and to see the good in itself.</p>
                <p>And when he has seen the good, he will be unwilling to return to the cave, and to the shadows which he formerly took for realities; but he will be compelled to go down again to his fellow-prisoners, and to share in their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or not. And this will be his justice—to do his duty to the state, and to govern it according to the pattern which he has seen in the heavens.</p>
                <p>But will he not be thought a fool by the world, and will he not be hated by those whom he governs?</p>
                <p>He may, I said; but he will care nothing for their opinion, for he will know that they are living in a world of shadows, and that their praises and censures are alike worthless. He will be like a man who has seen the sun, and who pities those who are sitting in darkness. And he will be willing to bear the injustice of the world, rather than to commit injustice himself; for he knows that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.</p>
                <p>This then, I said, is the philosopher-king, who is to be the ruler of our state; and this is the education which is to prepare him for his office. And if such an one can be found, then our state will be a reality, and not a dream only; and mankind will be happy, both in public and private life.</p>

                description: "The conclusion with a story about the afterlife",
                image: "republic.jpg",
                text: `<div class="episode-title">Book 10: The Journey of the Soul</div>
                <p>Er, the son of Armenius, by race a Pamphylian. He was slain in battle, and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and carried away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world.</p>
                <p>He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above.</p>
                <p>In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs.</p>
                <p>He drew near, and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place.</p>
                <p>Then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright. And arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath.</p>
                <p>And they told one another of what had happened by the way, those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty.</p>
                <p>The story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this: He said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold; or once in a hundred years—such being reckoned to be the length of man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years.</p>
                <p>If, for example, there were any who had been the cause of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion.</p>
                <p>I need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he described.</p>
                <p>He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another, "Where is Ardiaeus the Great?" (Now this Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)</p>
                <p>The answer of the other spirit was: "He comes not hither, nor will he ever come. And this," said he, "was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return into the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell."</p>
                <p>And of all the many terrors which they had endured, he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice; and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, and there were blessings as great.</p>
                <p>Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days, on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on the fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt of heaven, and holds together the circle of the universe, like the under-girders of a trireme.</p>
                <p>From these ends is extended the spindle of Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn. The shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and partly of other materials. Now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which fit into one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side, and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre of the eighth.</p>
                <p>The first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions—the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second. The largest (or fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the eighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another, and yellower than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest light; the fourth (Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness second.</p>
                <p>Now the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in one direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle turns on the knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone or note. The eight together form one harmony; and round about, at equal intervals, there is another band, three in number, each sitting upon her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens—Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and Lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then with the other.</p>
                <p>When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: "Hear the word of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you, but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser—God is justified."</p>
                <p>When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition. And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life, others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however, any definite character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of necessity become different. But there was every other quality, and they all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also.</p>
                <p>And here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and therefore the utmost care should be taken. Let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul, and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth, of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard. For we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death. A man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and similar villanies, he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself; but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible, not only in this life but in all that which is to come. For this is the way of happiness.</p>
                <p>And according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time: "Even for the last comer, if he chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless, and let not the last despair." And when he had spoken, he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny; his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own children. But when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot, he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything rather than himself. Now he was one of those who came from heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered state, but his virtue was a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. And it was true of others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from earth, having themselves suffered and seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. And owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good. For if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy here, and also his journey to another life and return to this, instead of being rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most curious, he said, was the spectacle—sad and laughable and strange; for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life.</p>
                <p>There he saw the soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women, hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men. The soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. About the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose, the soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. There came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last, and that he was delighted to have it. And not only did men pass into animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures—the good into the gentle, the evil into the savage, in all sorts of combinations.</p>
                <p>All the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus ratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to this, carried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them irreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped by the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot all things. Now after they had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered from drinking the water. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say; only, in the morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself lying on the pyre.</p>
                <p>And thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass safely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled. Wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil. Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods, both while remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing.</p>
